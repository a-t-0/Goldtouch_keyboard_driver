- `src`: The Python source code that allows you to verify and debug your Pico keyboard wiring. Flash Circuit Python `uf2` to your Pico, then copy the `src` folder into the Pico (USB) drive. Then open `thonny` then, inside `thonny`, open `src/pythontemplate/__main__.py` and run it by pressing the green run button. Then copy the code that is printed into the terminal into the `keyboard_driver/main.py` file.
- `circuitpython`: Contains a `flash_nuke.uf2` to factory reset your Pico. Contains Circuit Python v8.2.9. To flash a `uf2` file to your pico, press the bootsel button, then plugin the USB pico into your pc, and release the bootsel button when the Pico USB drive pops up on your pc. Then drag the `uf2` file into the Pico USB drive. Then wait until the circuitPython Pico USB drive pops up on your pc.
